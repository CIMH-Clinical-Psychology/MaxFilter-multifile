# MaxFilter-multifile
Script to filter several FIFF files from MEGIN TRIUX MEG machines sequentially with a GUI.

MaxFilterâ„¢ can only filter one FIFF file at a time. That is annoying if you have recordings with several sessions. This simple Python script offers a GUI solution (using [easygui](https://github.com/robertlugg/easygui)) to filter as many FIFF files as you want, given that they all need the same parameters.

You can select between 
- `SSS` or `tSSS`
- Movement compensation or none
- Head position transformation to `initial`, `default` or from another FIFF file
- Bad channel detection ([not recommended for tSSS](https://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/meg/maxbugs) artefacts such as braces)
- Optionally it can move the files after filtering to a specific location (customized to our setup, you would need to change the last lines of the script.)


### Requirements:**
`pip install easygui`

Any Python>=3.5 should work.
Then simply run `python maxfilter_multifile.py`
